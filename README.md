Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics Workbench
==========================================

TideSDK open-source application that seeks to consolidate proteomic toolsets into a unified platform to aid users of proteomic technologies.

Description
===========
The mass spectrometry and proteomic workbench is a open-source application to seeks to consolidate proteomic toolsets into a unified platform to aid users of proteomic technologies.  This project will entail the design and implementation of an extensible software framework that will allow the user to easily execute an array of complex data manipulation via a simple, intuitive graphical user interface.  The interface will be developed using HTML5 on top of the TideSDK framework.  In this manner, software can be developed simultaneously for desktop, web and mobile deployment. The first phase of development will focus on project file consolidation.  Phase 2 will incorporate server/desktop scripting to perform data analysis.  Metadata will be used to connect analysis functions with specified data by type.
